- Update class names with hyphen delimiter (CSS naming convention) instead of camelCase
- Improve class names for better readablility
Proposed changes:
  - .seladd -> .subject-add
  - .cardBody -> .subject-div
  - .cardDiv -> .subject
  - .card-header -> .subject-header
  - .rowInput -> .assessment-row
  - .weight-tooltip -> .weightage-tooltip
  - .field-max -> .assessment-marks
  - .numberBox -> .obtained-marks-input
  - .max-tooltip -> .max-marks-tooltip
  - .showMarks -> .show-marks
  - .showGrade -> .show-grade
  - .colorDivWrapper -> .themes-div
  - .color-div -> .theme-row
  - .radioDots -> .radio-dot
  - .paletteName -> .theme-name
  - .palettePreview -> .theme-palette

I might have missed something so just follow the above convention for renaming it. Also there are ids with same names as classes and I didn't include those above. Please change them as well

Wrap .subject-div (for now .cardBody) in .subject-wrapper
Wrap .results in .results-wrapper
.sgpa-div already wrapped in .sgpa-wrapper since its not generated by JS

Remove "display" manipulation from .results & .sgpa-div
For .subject-wrapper .sgpa-wrapper & .results-wrapper, calculate the div height and set the "max-height" to that value to make the div appear instead of doing "display flex". Visa-versa for "display none" ("max-height 0")

Remove CSS line 397-400

Add subjects to the top instead of the bottom
